This window object has the the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.
It holds things like window.location, window.history, window.screen, window.status, or the window.document .
Each browser tab has its own top-level window object. Each of these windows gets its own separate global object. window.window always refers to window, but window.parent and window.top might refer to enclosing windows, giving access to other execution contexts.

A document can also be window.document, screen can be window.screen, and window can be window.window (or window.window.window).
